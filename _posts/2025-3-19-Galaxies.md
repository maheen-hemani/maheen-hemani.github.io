title: Galaxy Formation and Evolution with SDSS 
---

It is impossible to understand the Universe without understanding galaxies. They are the building blocks of the Universe and yet are not properly understood. For astrophysicists to be able to understand galaxy formation and evolution, we have to acquire and process a lot of observational data. One such effort to study the Universe has been made possible with the help of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. It is an extremely large and detailed astronomical survey which is also one of the most cited surveys. Their telescope is located at the Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico and has a 2.5 meter diameter mirror [2]. One specific SDSS galaxy survey to note is from the SDSS III, Data Release 8, publically available since 2011. They collected spectroscopic galaxy data at low redshifts, which was reduced by MPA-JHU (Max Planck Institute of Astrophysics- John Hopkins University) and is presented in the form of a product called ‘Galspec’.

As an astrophysicist, I decided to explore galaxies at low redshifts i.e. in the recent Universe using this dataset. Although an older data release, I wanted to use this specific data since at times looking at older data can prove to be a useful cross-examination with the new data that can either help confirm previous results or help solve long held mysteries. Galspec data is quantitative in nature and consists of multiple variables with 1D arrays that reflect properties of 82944000 galaxies extracted from their spectroscopic emission and absorption lines. Some associated parameters include but are not limited to the unique ID of the object, observation plate number, Modified Julian Date, and fiber number of observation. It also consists of continuous variables which are representative of the galaxies observed and include oxygen abundance, entropy, stellar mass, specific and total star formation rates, redshifts, and velocity dispersions along with relevant errors. 

When it comes to identifying the gaps in knowledge on galaxy formation and evolution, one great paper I recommend reading is by Lucia et al. published in 2014, titled: “What Regulates Galaxy Evolution? Open questions in Our Understanding of Galaxy Formation and Evolution” [1]. This paper highlights and addresses the need to identify problematic areas in extragalactic astrophysics so we can have a better grasp of how galaxies work.
